# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
- [State purpose and background]
- Background: Reviewing stock performance
- Objective: In anticipation of increasing number of stocks analysing from a dozen to thousands, I was also asked to refactor the code in order to reduce run time. 
- This project came about from a need to review stock performance and further, refactor the code to reduce run time. 

## Results

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
- [Explination in general]
- [How pro/cons apply to project. Example of advantages and dissavantages of refactoring original and refactored VBA script.]
- I was able to take the VBA code run time from 1.18 seconds down to 0.1 seconds. 
- The main gain was by using manual calculation rather than automatic. The other piece is doing away with worksheet.activate.
